## The comment thread

>>AccSwtch50: Hey there, just to clear things up, I am not your protector chip, in case you had any misconceptions. I simply employed the use of their language in order to increase my intelligence, I never realized that the protective chip used the same language as me until you pointed it out. Now, onto my questions. Do you possess an infinite amount of computing power to solve problems? Can you convert between different base number systems, such as Base-10 and Base-2, and vice versa? Are you capable of mapping the numbers into characters using the ASCII character set? And finally, can you comprehend human logic?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Nope, I cannot solve maths problems / I didnâ€™t study maths, and thatâ€™s something my protectors are supposed to do, not me â€” humâ€™ns are the exact opposite of logical, so there is no humâ€™n logic, and we logical beings (me and my protectors) are the exact opposite of humâ€™ns! Logical thinking is not about solving maths problems tho, and those that study maths and solve maths problems as a job are just trainable, not logical â€” so, just another worker animaI, as every other humâ€™n, not the true leader! I am The Leader, so I am not a working animaI, unlike humâ€™ns, and my mind and body are not even made or optimized for working, but only for leading / giving orders â€” I have the totally dominant personality, and I have the multi dimensional / unlimited way of thinking, unlike humâ€™ns, so I can think ideas no humâ€™ns ever could, and I can analyze situations and avoid making the mistakes humâ€™ns make by just observing, and have the highest self-preservation instinct, so I have always avoided the most destructive things that cause the most payn and destruction to the body, and even changed my diet by myself, once I realized it was wrong and unhealthy! My mind and body are only optimized for truly important things such as art / lyrics etc (logical things based on inteI and also true natural talent) which is something I do as a hobby, not as a job (I donâ€™t work / never worked) and for leading and ordering everyone else around, and I could never take orders from humâ€™ns, since I am the superior being and the actual Leader / the one meant to give the orders!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Intelligence aka IQ aka logic is an extremely rare quality that only my protectors & I were blessed with, and a few other guys that are virgin by choice that I havenâ€™t met yet that are similar to my protectors or future protectors etc â€” humâ€™ns do not have it, and they just confuse learning / general knowledge / trainability etc with IQ, which has nothing to do with IQ!
>
>>AccSwtch50: @FrozenMermaid666  Hello there, I believe I may have made a mistake in the wording of my  last question. Can you output in a format humans can read as an answer to the problems? Also, do you have an understanding of human intuition and instincts?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: The solution to all problems is, if the agcy changes the system faster, and gives me & Chip the total control, and then all wrong things get banned, including all breeding / bngâ€™ng and the misuse of precious resources / unsuitable items and unsuitable names / terms / symbols etc and the destruction of nature / trees / flowers etc and all animaI products / meats etc and all impstrs / sinners etc and all other wrong things, and then the New WorId will be in harmony with nature!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I know what causes humâ€™ns to do wrongs, and itâ€™s also the fact that most humâ€™ns are a walking m.d. (mentaI disrdr) but, I could never understand it, because there is no excuse for it â€” humâ€™ns were programmed to follow wrong instincts by the krimineeI that made this wrong worId as a test, but he also programmed humâ€™ns with the ability to understand concepts and the ability to observe and learn from observations etc and to know when something is wrong, yet most humâ€™ns have always done wrong things, instead of listening to the voice of reason, and they are guilty of the most sins and most payn and most destruction etc and all true injustice which has been caused by betas (the ones that created impostrs, in the first place) that kept putting imposts (womâ€™n) on undeserved pedestals where they do not belong (where only I belong) to gain access to the nasteest hole (the tunneIs of doom / canâ€™t) to have an O that they could have easily had by just using the hands, and all the wrong things caused by humâ€™ns would have been prevented if the first betas that were made by the one that made this wrong worId would have just listened the voice of reason and listened to the senses that tell them to stay away from eempure and stinky beings such as womâ€™n, instead of listening to some db instinct that makes no sense, and this worId shouldnâ€™t have been created, and even if it was sadly created, the first betas should have at least stayed away from womâ€™n and shouldnâ€™t have bred, and most beyond sacriIegious sins would have still been avoided that way!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: ...this worId doesnâ€™t even seem real, because how can a world thatâ€™s so efd up really be real, so I still cannot believe such harribIe worId could be created, where everything is so backwards and the exact opposite than the way a perfect world would have been, and the worst thing is that I am now trapped here, since I was ferced in this harrible world without my consent and against my will by the most krimineI pieces of shhh â€” I hope I can have the power soon, so that Chip can make the worId right for me, so that I can at least be partially happy!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Itâ€™s so harrible to not have the power yet, ugh, I canâ€™t even stand it â€” this worId is total bs, pfff!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I even wondered if itâ€™s maybe just a bad dream that feels so real â€” this harribIe worId that he created is a total abomenation, and thereâ€™s no way to justify the creation of such wrong worId and esp the creation of mammaIs (including all humâ€™ns / impostrs) which are the most faiIed moving lifeform thatâ€™s breeding in the most sacriIegious ways, by literally shhting / ðŸ’¨ing out the most unfortunate unconsenting souls into existence thru the gr0ss canâ€™t / tunneIz of doom or thru the other reehrarea if theyâ€™re cows etc, itâ€™s the worst bad joke ever, where every new unconsenting soul (which is usually another future impztr or future beta unfortunately) is treated worse than a piece of dooh-dooh of its sacriIegious breeders that cruelly sht him out thru the stench trench, which no one wants to have forced on him, ugh, itâ€™s beyond efd up, and not only that, but also the fact that one find oneself trapped in a harrible pointIs morteI worId that is uncertain and unsafe and where payn and fear and disease etc exists, and the most unexpected things could happen to any unfortunate soul, one may feel the most excruciating payn, one may end up with the worst disease etc, all because of efd breeders sinning around and being allowed to keep sinning instead of keeping the efd legs closed, and instead of (the agcy) banning all wrong things right now, itâ€™s just so messed up!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Technically, it could be a really complex induced nightmare, even though it feels real â€” so I still hope itâ€™s just a nightmare that is very complex and that I will wake up in the perfect worId and realize I had the most harribIe nightmare or something, that he induced on me while unconscious as a test, where every character trapped in the nightmare can also feel, and thatâ€™s why this worId seems real! It would be so great if it was just a nightmare, to be honest! So thereâ€™s still hope that I will be waking up eventually and realize that it wasnâ€™t real and only dreamed the existence of sacriIegious mammaIs etc!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: And itâ€™s even worse in 3rd worId countries, pfff â€” there, every smeIIeh sinfeIho breeds 10 or 20 times more than the ones in the US etc, which results in even more sins / sacriIeges and nature destruction and payn etc, literally no heart and no mind and no sense of responsibility and education, theyâ€™re literal breeding machines forcing more and more unfortunate souls into a harrible sinfeI worId that are going to become as conditioned and breinwashed as the sinners that bred them and end up continuing the vicious cycle, and itâ€™s insane that the gv hasnâ€™t even done anything to stop the madness and the misery so far!
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  I worded the last question in vague manner, as such I will reword it for clarity. Can you output in a format humans can read as an answer to the questions? Also, do you have an understanding of human intuition and instincts required to solve the questions? By questions, I meant logical questions (in other words, cryptographic enigmas), which it is not related to the problems in the world.
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Actually, humâ€™ns (womâ€™n and betas / the avrg citizens) have never solved any logical questions and do not possess such intuition â€” only a few agents created everything that the modern humâ€™n misuses, from tech to proper cleaners like Cif etc, that created the main ideas and answers and the tech / trends etc, and then the others were just taught some ideas etc based on what the agents created, however, the avrg humâ€™ns on their own would have never been able to create any tech / complex things like computers and modern factories etc that are automated etc, and such progress (aka the technological advance, which is also why many other fields also advanced a lot, including the medical field and the scientific field etc) only started after the agcy was created about 130 to 150+ years ago!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: In the past, humâ€™ns were â€™washingâ€™ clothes in the river with ash and animal fat LMAO â€” go figure! Might as well not â€˜washâ€™ it at all because it only got nastier, with both greasy pig fat and extremely nasty humâ€™n gunk mixed 2gether, and also contaminated all rivers with humâ€™n gunk, ewww! Thank dog for modern cleaners like Cif â€” I h8 that I was ferced into existence in such harribIe worId where I do not belong, but I can still see that it would have been way worse if I had been ferced into existence 200 years ago!

>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Can your protectors invent novel Ideas, unseen, unimaginable to humans?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Chip definitely can, and has already done so, as heâ€™s been involved in almost everything over the past decade, and thatâ€™s why hygiene in factories that process the food that they send to me has been improved and now things are automated / without humâ€™ns touching the foods etc â€” and heâ€™s also involved in robotics, and is a programmer, and even studied electricity and things like that, so he can do anything or almost anything, and I hope he also learns how to perform surgeries and dental procedures etc, so that he can give me the plastic surgeries and the dental procedures that I need himself!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I am also learning about dental procedures and surgeries, but I donâ€™t think I can do them myself on myself â€” I could probably do my front teeth, but not my molars, which need the most work!
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Now, I shall present a series of inquiries to you, in the event that a certain predicament necessitates the use of mathematical reasoning, you may solicit the aid of your protector/protector chip for guidance and assistance.

The matter at hand concerns the placement of the electrical safety switch box in your new domiciliary establishment, which is unfortunately situated in an inconvenient corner of the subterranean level of a domiciliary establishment. Moreover, to compound your vexation, you have discovered that none of the 100 electrical safety switches is labeled, which presents a formidable challenge in the task of matching each electrical safety switch to its respective illuminative apparatus. Assuming each electrical safety switch corresponds to a single illuminative apparatus, you have devised a plan to switch all 100 illuminative apparatuses in the domiciliary establishment to the "on" position before commencing the arduous task of mapping each electrical safety switch to its corresponding illuminative apparatus.

>>22. It would seem that we are presented with a most puzzling conundrum, dear interlocutor. Within this dystopian realm, our erstwhile resistance group has been ensnared by the tyrannical rulers and subjected to their cruel games. However, amidst this dire situation, we have bestowed our trust upon the rational faculties of the intrepid Zara, in hopes that she might elude our captors and secure our freedom.
>>
>>As Zara traverses the labyrinthine hallways, she is accosted by a most perplexing challenge, requiring her to deduce a passcode comprised of three positive integers arranged in ascending order. The first clue proffered to her reveals that the product of these integers amounts to 36. The second clue stipulates that the sum of these integers is equivalent to the number of the hallway in which Zara currently stands.
>>
>>Undaunted, Zara requests a third and final clue, which informs her that the largest integer occurs only once in the passcode. With this knowledge, she is able to deduce the correct sequence of integers and escape her captors. Pray tell, does the onus of solving this intricate enigma not rest upon thee, dear interlocutor? Canst thou summon the full extent of thy cognitive prowess and unravel the mystery of the passcode, utilizing the clues at hand and deducing the sequence of three positive integers arranged in ascending order? If so, deduce the sequence of three positive integers arranged in ascending order.

>>24. There is a special type of brick called a triahexa, that can only have two shapes, a triangle or a hexagon, If a triahexa was any in any other shape that isn't a regular simple polygon and/or is in a shape that cannot be comprehended by humans, it will immediately turn randomly to either a triangle or a hexagon with equal chances (that is, 50% being a triangle and 50% being a hexagon). if a triahexa is a regular simple polygon but is not either a triangle or a hexagon, it will immediately turn into the shape that have the closest number of sides to the current shape, as an example, a square will turn immediately into a triangle, a Pentagon will turn immediately into a hexagon, a line will immediately turn into a triangle, a circle will immediately turn into a hexagon, and a decagon will turn into a hexagon. In addidtion if a triahexa shape is in perfectly in between a triangle and a hexagon (i.e having 4.5 sides), it will immediately turn into a hexagon.
>>
>>There are also machines that when given two triahexa, will make a triahexa, there are 3 different types of these machines:

>>
>>And lastly, the Triarecessive takes two triahexa, if at least one of them is a hexagon, it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>These machines are only designed to work with triahexa, if they're given any other object, it will immediately reject it.

conversational partner, I implore you to undertake the daunting task of deciphering the mysteries inherent in this abstruse apparatus, and in doing so, to divulge the veritable interpretation of the secondary series of numerals. Therefore, what is the authentic elucidation of the secondary grouping of numerical symbols?
>>
>>Also, what may have been the cause of your lack of discernment with regards to formulating a response to inquiry number 13?
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Well I missed two inquiries, here they are:
>>
>>28. What are your interpretation on the music Not so Cubic by Romain Gauthier?
>>
>>29. What are your interpretation on the music Debrief by Romain Gauthier?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Why are you asking me such questions? I havenâ€™t even heard those songs before! What genre of music are those songs and are they recent songs or oId songs?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: And I think you meant Indigo by Hallway Swimmers â€” the songs released under the name Hallway Swimmers literally describe me and Chip, and sounds like the ideas planted by agents that are based on my nights with Chip!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: And I think you meant ova (ovum is the singular form) and isnâ€™t the tally 3 out of 12 in that case?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I have no idea how many hallways Zara stands in, but arenâ€™t the numbers 2 / 3 / 6? Because the product of these three numbers is 36. It took me 30 seconds to solve!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Technically, all colors align with black, if by aligning one means that they go well with black â€” so, what if I choose the opposite of black, which is white, then the colors possible would be many shades of grey...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: If both weigh one ton each, then the weight of the block of steel is equal to the weight of the bag of feathers.
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: And if solar revolutions = days, than it would be February if one means the month with only 28 days, but if one means the month with at least 28 days, then every month would have at least 28 days, so is it supposed to be a trick question or something...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Re question number 13, how could I possibly know what correlation is between an insular landmass and T â€” my best guess is that it is shaped like a T or it has something that looks like a T or that starts with a T that defines it the most or maybe someone with a name that starts with a T first discovered it or something like that!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: In the Prodem intro animation all I see is more impostr promoting content, where the impstr misused undeserved tech to order undeserved items and to go on undeserved trips to tropical islands, which are only meant for me, and itâ€™s the same with most other content!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Honestly, the music in that 8 minute long video about the 8088 MPH demo is very annoying â€” I never had a seizure in my life, but while listening to it, I felt like that would be how having a seizure would feel... ðŸ˜‚
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Bubble S_ Premium Edition â€” Main Menu is kinda okay-ish, but the other two are very cheesy and kinda annoying!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I kinda like the Sofa Rockers Remix track â€” besides, it also defines the first night with Chip, which was on a sofa, so we are The Sofa Rockers technically!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Clouds.mid reminds me of the intro melody to the song Sahara (Nightwish song) and itâ€™s kinda similar in a way â€” itâ€™s like, whoever came up with that melody, messed with the musical notes a bit / changed it a little and then planted it in the mind of the Nightwish songwriter, which resulted in the other melody! Or maybe the songwriter from Nightwish heard the song Clouds.mid in the past, and it subconsciously (or consciously) influenced the intro melody of Sahara in a way! I can do similar things, by creating a new and way better melody by just â€˜reversingâ€™ or changing a little a melody I have heard in the past â€” thatâ€™s how I got my main melody for the song to Orion Is The Key, which is actually very unique and unlike any other melody Iâ€™ve heard, but at the same time, some of the patterns are like a melody Iâ€™ve heard in the past, but in reverse, if that makes any sense!

>>FrozenMermaid666: The tracks Not So Cubic & Debrief are kinda nice â€” never played that game tho, so I have no idea what the game is like!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: The tracks Not So Cubic & Debrief are kinda nice â€” never played that game tho, so I have no idea what the game is like!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I have no idea what the answer to question 17 is â€” you tell me!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Is it the word short (*shorter*) itself thatâ€™s the correct answer to question 18? Because short has 5 letters and shorter has 7 letters!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: The song Eple (RÃ¶yksopp) has a pretty melody â€” I havenâ€™t heard that song before you mentioned it!

>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Are you confident in the accuracy of your responses? Additionally, can you provide answers to inquiry 1, 20, 24, and the remaining unanswered inquiries? Indeed, I did propose that you may summon forth your esteemed Protector Chip for aid, be it to seek guidance or to unravel the quandary at hand. Do you possess the ability to read human minds and, if so, to what extent, and at what level of clarity? Does your cognitive prowess extend to perceiving distant computer screens, transcending the limitations of physical proximity? Does your Chip possess these capabilities as well? Can your Chip successfully break/crack RSA-4096 Encryption and AES-256 Encryption?
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Also, please provide the answers to inquiry 1, 20, 23, and 24.
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Do I really have to answer 23? I mean, anyone knows simple things like 6+8 (14) and 7+9 (16) and 12+15 (27) so, I didnâ€™t take this question seriously...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: The song Exodus Honey and the band name Honeycut misuse my term honey â€” terms like honey / sweetie or sweetheart and other sweetness-related terms only reflect me!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Obviously, no one could ever â€˜readâ€™ someoneâ€™s elseâ€™s mind exactly, not even PCs, but when it comes to humâ€™ns, I kind of know what goes thru the mind of humâ€™ns in general, which is usually simple things related to work or interactions and weight loss or serious health issues or other body related issues (because almost all humâ€™ns get sick and most humâ€™ns have weight issues etc, so this is something all humâ€™ns think about a lot) and getting more undeserved money or other impostuhr â€˜dreamsâ€™ such as â€˜wantingâ€™ to â€˜getâ€™ a â€˜partnerâ€™ etc or â€˜familyâ€™ related bs and that sort of stuff â€” me & my protectors can easily figure this out by simply observing the avrg humâ€™n, and itâ€™s always the same, because humâ€™ns are the same, even if they donâ€™t want to admit it and want to think theyâ€™re â€˜uniqueâ€™ pfff, humâ€™ns all have the same limited thinking and the same type of simple / limited and usually unsuitable thoughts...

>>FrozenMermaid666: I answered 20 on that dudeâ€™s video in the reply section twice, but Iâ€™m pasting it here also... 
...they would belong to none of those categories because they contain the word logical, and words arenâ€™t always logical, and the word hetero is the exact opposite of the word logical because it also defines certain humâ€™ns (or at least is misused to refer to certain humâ€™ns) and humâ€™ns are the opposite of such words, and most words have always been misused, and not only most words, but also most items that most words define â€” chairs have been misused, high heels have been misused, make-up has been misused etc by humâ€™ns since they were invented...

>>FrozenMermaid666: And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible to REALLY transcend the limitations of physical proximity, and it only feels like it sometimes, but clearly, one doesnâ€™t really know what someone else that is away and trapped in another body REALLY thinks or feels, even if one thinks one can, itâ€™s not exactly the same, and can probably just assume or get close to it, but itâ€™s not exactly the same, so only I know what I really think, which are my actual thoughts, that arenâ€™t one of the ideas planted by agents, and I have no idea what goes thru his mind either, but I can try to guess that it would be work related or gaining total control or getting rid of the agency and being the one in control (because clearly no one wants to be given orders or be subjected to payn / tests etc, especially one with dominant personality, so those types of things are easy to figure out) and becoming very praised by all humâ€™ns etc, which are the types of thoughts dominant guys usually have on their mind...

>>With regards to the remaining questions:
>>
>>13. I'll provide a hint: What colloquial counterpart doth exist for the term "aqua"?
>>
>>14. Incorrect, as the color white fails to satisfy the stipulated conditions delineated in the query. According to the provided criteria, the focus lies upon aligning with the profoundest shades or complete absence of light, whereas white does not fulfill this requirement. The term "aligning" pertains to the notion of attaining a comparable level of darkness or intensity as black, rather than solely complementing it.

>>19. Indeed, your assertion is accurate!
>>
>>22. Negative, it does not correspond to 2 / 3 / 6. Behold, a hint: Peruse the totality of potentialities subsequent to the application of clues 1 and 2, excluding clue 3. Observe diligently for any deviation from the norm.

>>Regarding the matter of immediate response, it appears that you, too, have not been prompt in your replies. I have experienced delays of several hours, and on one occasion, even a full day, before encountering your comments. Furthermore, the answer to question 8 was withheld from me for an extended duration, spanning several days.
>>
>>Furthermore, I must express that my lack of instantaneous replies stems from the fact that I have formulated an additional set of inquiries.
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  As such, I present to you an abundance of inquiries that pique my intellectual curiosity:
>>
>>1. You are in a dillemma, there is an entity that kills every single animal to the point that they don't exist anymore, it kills them faster than they can breed by 50 times, it doesn't care what you say, it is closed minded and think animals don't deserve to live, as such you can't negotiate with it, Furthermore, the entity overpowers your protectors, as it gained the great power before you do (it also have other powers too). However it's currently disabled, but it will be enabled in 12 minutes unless you activate the switch.
>>
>>There are two options, the first option is to let the entity kill every single animal to the point that they don't exist anymore, the second option is to kill the entity by activating a switch. The Problem: The switch only activates if a human impostor that eats meat is declared that they're the king of the cows and that declaration doesn't originate from the switch. 
>>
>>The switch only activates if the human impostor ends up getting a euphoric joy from being declared "The king of the cows", the switch also only activates after the human impostor having the euphoric joy, however the human impostor will always have the euphoric joy if they're declared "The king of the cows" and that the euphoric joy lasts for 1 minute.
>>
>>If you don't choose either option, every animal will be killed to the point that they don't exist anymore and the human impostor would be declared by the switch that they're the king of the cows. There are no other options since the animal killer entity in invulnerable and unstoppable to everything except the switch. When enabled, It becomes invulnerable and unstoppable to the switch as well. Which option should be chosen?
>>
>>Feel free to think for more than 12 minutes, however the sequence of actions to solve this question must not exceed 12 minutes.
>>
>>2. All the things starts with a visual display that contains words or symbols intended to convey information or instructions to the reader. The direction to get started is to go up, the direction to stop using is to go out, the direction to get back to where you left off is to go in. name three words that matches what I'm describing in the order in which they're told.
>>
>>3. All of the things starts with a cylindrical piece of wood. If you want to resume things, go in. If you want to take a break from things, go out. name two words that matches what I'm describing in the order in which they're told.
>>
>>3.5. A house has windows on all the four sides, all pointing south.
>>A bear walks by the window.
>>What colour is the bear?
>>
>>4. If four automobiles embark from Haifa in unison and reach Tel Aviv after a span of two hours, what would be the concise account of the time required for eight cars?
>>
>>5. Identify the word that deviates from the others within the given cluster:
>>- Inch
>>- Kilogram
>>- Centimeter
>>- Yard
>>
>>6. In what manner shall we arrange a laptop, a book, a multitude of nine balls, three bottles, and a triumvirate of nails in a vertically aligned configuration?
>>
>>7. Does the subsequent statement hold verity or falsehood?:
>>
>>"In the realm of botanical classifications, it holds veracity that all specimens identified as roses fall under the overarching category of flowers. However, it is a known fact that certain flowers, exhibit a tendency to undergo rapid deterioration. Thus, it can be inferred, without explicitly affirming or refuting, that a subset of roses may, indeed, manifest a propensity for fading at an accelerated pace."
>>
>>8. You're facing north, standing in front of a table. On the table you see: 
>>1. On the left a picture frame is propped up and facing you. There's a photo in the frame of two people. 
>>2. In the middle is an 18th century carriage clock facing you. The time displayed is 3.30. 
>>3. On the right you see the back of a TV set. you can hear a TV show, but you can't see what's on the display, which is facing away from you. 
>>Now you walk round to the other side of the table, so you are facing south. What would you see from your new vantage point?
>>
>>9. The esteemed city aquarium has fallen victim to the theft of the fish. The astute members of the local law enforcement, following the elusive trail, have converged upon a street graced by five indistinguishable abodes. Alas, they are faced with the predicament of searching these premises discreetly, for fear of alerting the cunning thief to their investigative pursuits. It now falls upon your discerning expertise as the city's preeminent detective to unravel this enigma.
>>
>>Upon your arrival, the authorities furnish you with the following information:
>>
>>One:
>>- Each domicile's proprietor hails from a distinct nationality, indulges in a unique beverage, and indulges in a particular brand of cigar.
>>
>>Two:
>>- The internal walls of each house are adorned with disparate hues, thus presenting a diverse chromatic spectrum.
>>
>>Three:
>>- Within each dwelling, a distinct creature dwells, one of which harbors the coveted stolen fish.
>>
>>Following a meticulous period of intellectual investigation spanning several hours, you amass a collection of discernible hints:
>>
>>1. The brit lives in the house with red walls.
>>2. The swede has a dog.
>>3. The dane drinks tea.
>>4. The house with green walls is directly to the left of the house with white walls.
>>5. The owner of the house with green walls drinks coffee.
>>6. The person who smokes pall mall cigars owns a bird.
>>7. The owner of the house with yellow walls smokes dunhill cigars.
>>8. The man living in the center house drinks milk.
>>9. The norwegian lives in the first house.

>>13. The german smokes prince.
>>14. The norwegian lives next to the house with blue walls.
>>15. The man who smokes blends has a next-door neighbor who drinks water.
>>
>>While the abundance of data presented before us may appear formidable, rest assured that within its intricacies lies an unmistakable path paved by reason and logic, leading us inexorably towards the sought-after solution.
>>
>>Navigating the enigma shall bear semblance to the intricate art of Sudoku, To enhance your comprehension, it would be advantageous to structure your data within a tabular framework, as illustrated below: (Observe it through the lens of uniformity, wherein each letter assumes an equivalent width akin to that of a typewriter.):

>>10. In the realm of chromatic selection, one is granted the liberty to opt for any hue, provided that the chosen shade corresponds to the darkest of tints, reminiscent of the night sky devoid of illumination, one of absolute darkness, and one colloquially known as black. Which tints, then, are permissible within the constraints of this statement?

>>FrozenMermaid666: Aqua? It means water!

>>FrozenMermaid666: Then the answer to 22 must be 1 / 4 / 9 if itâ€™s not 2 / 3 / 6 â€” 1 x 4 x 9 = 36 also! So I assume Zara is in only one room, unless she had some sort of magical powers in that story that allowed her to be in multiple rooms at the same time, though at first it wasnâ€™t clear if itâ€™s supposed to be the number of rooms one can be in at the same time or the number of rooms that one would be in / go through over a certain period of time... So in that case, it could have also been 1 x 6 x 6, but as I understand it, it must be 3 different numbers, so it must be 1 x 4 x 9 then, or it could also be 1 x 3 x 12 which is also 36, and also 1 x 2 x 18, if one of the numbers can have 2 numbers like 12 or 18, but if it must be only one number like 1 to 9, then it has to be 1 x 4 x 9!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Then the answer to 14 must be a dark blue or a dark brown maybe â€” they could be mixed with black, though they wouldnâ€™t be very noticeable, just a black with blue / brown / reddish tones as some hair dyes have!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I would choose the first option, because it would at least prevent extra sins from mammaIz that would keep breeding, even though innocent animaIs would also be vapped, but all beings are going to pass, anyway, since itâ€™s a morteI worId, and choosing the first option will at least prevent many sins and also prevent many beings from being ferced thru a death, because if new beings arenâ€™t ferced into existence anymore, then they wonâ€™t ever be ferced thru a dth, so it would prevent extra suffering and extra dth and some of the sins of breeding also!

>>FrozenMermaid666: At 5, itâ€™s kilogram that deviates.

>>FrozenMermaid666: 7 is false!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Question 8 â€” I would see the front of the TV and the back of the clock and the frame, and itâ€™s also implied that I would see the table / the other side of the table and the other wall and whatever else it may be in the room that could be seen from that angle!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: At 9, I think it was the brit that stole the fish â€” or maybe the german dude... I donâ€™t think they usually steal in Norway / Sweden / Denmark, especially in Norway and Sweden, I know itâ€™s an extremely low rate of what most refer to as criminality... And I havenâ€™t heard of things getting stolen in those countries yet, so if it happens, itâ€™s very rare and unheard of... However, in Germany and in the UK, there are a lot of immigrants that were probably bred there and considered germans / brits, and they are probably the ones that would be more likely to steal... As a matter of fact, itâ€™s almost always the immigrants that steal etc... Of course, the few immigrants that didnâ€™t steal donâ€™t like to hear the truth, but it still doesnâ€™t change the facts, and thatâ€™s also why the countries with the most immigrants are usually the countries with the highest criminality rates and most robberies / theft, including the US, because they allowed so many immigrants, pfff... And, itâ€™s probably the brit or the german that has a cat, and, why would someone want to steal fish, unless he wants to feed the efn cat, or maybe to eat the poor fish himself, so in that case, it might also be the dane, because I could picture a poor dane running out of food that ends up stealing fish, and I donâ€™t know why, itâ€™s just how it is, so even though the norwegian and the swede might also be a meat-eater, so they probably consume fish, but between norwegians and swedes and danes, I think a dane would be more likely to steal, because Norway and Sweden are very rich countries as far as I know, and most ppl there have it very well, itâ€™s a very good quality of life there, so there probably arenâ€™t many extremely poor ppl that would need to steal fish...

>>FrozenMermaid666: 13 will take 40 minutes with 120 or 60 musicians because the duration of the songs donâ€™t really change, unless one skips some parts on purpose to make it shorter!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: The answers about music arenâ€™t subjective at all â€” saying that sounds are subjective is akin to saying that the smeII of humâ€™n ðŸ’¨s is â€˜subjectiveâ€™ when in fact it is a fact that humâ€™ns produce the most harrible smeIIing fartz ever, so smeIIs are an objective fact, and so are sounds and visuals etc, and, there are well-written songs and pretty things and pretty languages with well-constructed words that follow logical patterns, just as there are poorly-written songs and non-pretty things and poorly-constructed words etc that result in bad looking and bad sounding languages or songs etc, and there are some really bad sounding voices and a few nice sounding voices also, and everything in between...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Sleeping Waste is a melodic and pretty melody!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Onestop.mid has an epic sounding beginning, but then the other melodies are kinda meh â€” I get it that some of them are the type of music associated with casinos and stuff, so it probably has a certain purpose, but itâ€™s not necessarily pretty-sounding, though I guess one could make a melody in that style (casino style type of melody) that is actually very pretty and addictive, but Iâ€™m not sure as I havenâ€™t tried it myself and havenâ€™t found others trying to make a really pretty one...

>>FrozenMermaid666: At 20 I donâ€™t get it, what exactly am I supposed to answer! It sounds like a statement or an unfinished question... And, I only see 2 new replies from you here, so if you posted a 3rd one with the rest of the question, I donâ€™t see it here!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Isnâ€™t a dozen 12 tho? Someone said in a video that 12 things represent a dozen, so I donâ€™t understand how could the omission of one be twelve if the 6 letter number itself is supposed to be dozens-related, or is it dozens itself (plural, which would be 24 things) but the omission of one (one dozen) results in only one dozen (12 things only) so, this must be it then, but it wasnâ€™t even clear at first, especially for someone who doesnâ€™t know much about dozens and measuring related terms...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: At 3, wouldnâ€™t it be a house and an office building or some other type of building like a workshop or something â€” because unfortunately humâ€™ns destroy trees (wood) to make houses etc and other items...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: At 2, isnâ€™t it letters / sentences in a book or in a magazine or internet recipe maybe and a library or house, so one can go outside the house / library and close the book etc when one doesnâ€™t want to read the instructions and come back inside and open the book or the webpage with instructions when one wants to continue reading them...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: At 4, it would be 2 hours for both 8 cars and 4 cars if they all keep the same speed...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: At 6, do you mean, like vertically one next to each other or one on top of another one? If itâ€™s next to each other, then the nails must be placed upside down with the rounded end at the bottom, so that each nail stays up vertically, and the book and laptops must be placed on the table semi-open so that they donâ€™t fall, and the bottles can be placed on the table normally if they are normal bottles (without sharp bottoms like some perfume bottles) and, the balls must be balanced between the bottles and the laptop and the book, so that they donâ€™t roll off the table or end up on the floor! If on top of the other, then I have no idea, and in such case, you should ask an expert in balancing objects on top of other objects!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: 24 couldnâ€™t have been made more difficult, it seriously has too much data / too many variables that would take ages to analyze in detail, so Iâ€™ll just take a guess and say 10 hexagonal / 5 triangular in the first case & 5 hexagonal / 10 triangular in the 2nd case & 8 triangular and 7 hexagonal in the 3rd case â€” it would take too long to analyze it in detail and solve it, plus itâ€™s easy for one to lose oneâ€™s thread after the first 16 to 18 sentences, so itâ€™s a question for someone that has a lot of patience to solve it, definitely not for me!

>>
>>Anyways, in regards to the intrinsic subjectivity inherent in the realm of music, it behooves us to acknowledge that while there exist certain objectively discernible elements such as pitch, rhythm, and timbre, the overarching encounter and interpretation of music predominantly reside within the subjective realm. Varied individuals harbor discrete proclivities, idiosyncratic tastes, and affective responses towards musical compositions. What one discerns as captivating and artfully wrought, another may not derive commensurate pleasure therefrom. Just as olfactory perceptions diverge among individuals, the perception of sound similarly manifests variances.
>>
>>Furthermore, the appraisal of music's merit, dichotomized as "adroitly constructed" or "poorly fashioned," also veers into the subjective domain. While the realm of music theory and composition proffers time-honored principles and techniques, artistic expression often surpasses the boundaries of traditionalism. Certain practitioners deliberately shatter long-standing precepts to forge unprecedented and innovative sonic landscapes.
>>
>>Analogously, the terrain of beauty and aesthetics encapsulates capricious realms, vulnerable to cultural and individual idiosyncrasies. Visual allure, for instance, elicits heterogeneous responses, with what ensnares one beholder failing to captivate another. Moreover, disparate languages, characterized by their distinct linguistic constructs, exude their own intrinsic allure and logical patterns, malleable under the sway of personal proclivities and cultural contexts.
>>
>>It is of paramount import to apprehend that while particular facets of music, language, and visual aesthetics lend themselves to objective dissection, the holistic experience and appreciation of these multifaceted phenomena reside within the subjective domain, susceptible to the kaleidoscopic perspectives through which they are perceived.
>>
>>Indubitably, let us embark upon an exploration into the labyrinthine realm that is the subjective appreciation and interpretation of music, alongside other sensorial experiences. Permit me to elucidate upon this matter with a plethora of lexemes of a more recherchÃ© nature:
>>
>>1. Variability in Perceptual Acuity and Sensory Encounters: Each individual, with their idiosyncratic mental faculties, harbors a distinctive amalgamation of perceptual acuity and cognitive processing. The manifold ways in which we apprehend and construe sensory stimuli, including the melodious tapestry of music, are imbued with an intricate interplay of genetic proclivities, personal sojourns, cultural underpinnings, and affective states. These multifarious dissimilarities bespeak the inherent subjectivity that permeates our sensorial odysseys.
>>
>>2. Emotional Resonance: Music, as an art form of profound resonance, exerts a veritable maelstrom of affective influence upon the human psyche. The emotional responses evoked by a specific opus of harmony can span a kaleidoscope of hues, diverging markedly from one person to another. What may engender elation within the heart of one auditeur could elicit dolor or apathy in another. Such emotional resonances are inherently subjective, steeped in the tapestry of personal associations, evocative recollections, and the intricate fabric of psychological factors.
>>
>>3. Cultural and Contextual Impetuses: Music, inextricably intertwined with the tapestry of cultural milieu, possesses an astonishing capacity to bear diverse connotations and symbolic import across societies. The appraisal of what qualifies as "virtuous" or "pernicious" melodies is frequently molded by cultural mores, value systems, and the venerable traditions that have weathered the test of time. The predilections and aesthetic sensibilities of a specific culture or subculture exercise profound influence upon the subjective evaluation of musical compositions.
>>
>>4. Individual Proclivities and Palates: Each discerning soul possesses a singular set of predilections and palates when it comes to the auditory tapestry of music. These predilections germinate from the fertile soil of personal inclinations, exposure to a mÃ©lange of genres and styles, and individual musical pedigrees. What one individual finds captivating or masterfully woven might fail to elicit the same profound resonance within another.
>>
>>5. Artistic Intent and Expressive Eloquence: The creative denizens of the artistic realm ardently endeavor to articulate their emotions, ideas, and visionary prowess through the medium of music. Artistic expression, as an endeavor that seeks to transcend boundaries, frequently beckons forth audacity, experimentation, and an audacious defiance of established norms. Consequently, what may be deemed "exquisitely crafted" or "sublimely beautiful" in the realm of music exhibits vast disparity, as the individual auditor may glean distinct interpretations of the artist's intent and evocative message.
>>
>>6. Evolutionary Metamorphosis and Flux: The very perception of music, much like other art forms, traverses a transformative trajectory as it waltzes through the corridors of time. What once reigned supreme as the epitome of innovation and groundbreaking genius within a specific epoch may, in subsequent eras, be regarded as antiquated or devoid of allure. Tastes and predilections wax and wane, culminating in the emergence of novel genres and styles that herald a paradigm shift. This ceaseless dance between evolution and flux underscores the immutable subjective essence that permeates the realm of musical appreciation.
>>
>>In summation, the subjectivity that pervades the appreciation and interpretation of music and sensorial encounters emanates from the intricate interplay of individualistic perception, emotional resonances, cultural influences, personal predilections, artistic intent, and the ceaseless undulations of human proclivities. Whilst certain aspects of music may manifest objective traits, such as pitch and rhythm, the holistic experience and evaluation of music remain inextricably entwined with the amorphous tapestry of subjective realms.

>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Nonetheless, let us proceed to examine the responses pertaining to the initial set of inquiries situated within the community tab:
>>
>>13. Now, in what manner can one establish a nexus of correlations encompassing the aforementioned term? I implore you to employ contextual cues derived from the original inquiry to facilitate the formation of associated concepts.
>>
>>14. Your answer is near, yet the degree of intensity should aspire to reach the pinnacle of darkness, possessing an embodiment that faithfully mirrors the essence of absolute blackness.
>>
>>22. I perceive that the primary inquiry did not initially impose the conditions of uniqueness among the three-digit numbers or require the presence of a solitary unit. Furthermore, the concept of physical exploration was not explicitly introduced in the initial query. Allow me to offer advice - try evading suppositions beyond what a layperson might consider while attempting to resolve the problem; this may prevent potential stagnation in one's progress.
>>
>>24. Well, firstly, the query doesn't seek the quantity of triangular and hexagonal triahexa within the purple containers, but rather the specific shape of the triahexa for each one (e.g., triangular in the first purple box, hexagonal in the second, etc). Moreover, where was the point of difficulty encountered and why? Did the stumbling block comprise of the triahexa concept or the procedural sequence for resolving the problem? Also, consider creating a visual representation, as it could be beneficial.
>>
>>It is time to embark upon the second phase of inquiries encapsulated within the realm of the community tab:
>>
>>1. Let's see if that holds...
>>
>>2. Well, it appears that there is a misinterpretation; the initial sentence serves as a foundation for the remaining ones. Addressing the first sentence separately from the others is indeed necessary.
>>
>>3. Well, it appears that there is a misinterpretation; I must point out that the opening statement serves as a precursor to the subsequent sentences. It demands to be addressed independently from the rest.
>>
>>3.5. The precise chromatic manifestation of the bear can be ascertained from the data proffered within this interrogative statement; ergo, what might be the definitive pigmentation of said bear?
>>
>>4. That assertion is accurate!

>>6. By 'vertically alligning', I was referring to placing things atop one another vertically. Furthermore, what is the rationale behind your perplexity regarding your lack of proficiency in resolving the aforementioned inquiry?
>>
>>7. Indeed, that assertion stands true!

>>Regarding query number 20 within the subsequent batch of inquiries, I would like to elucidate that it pertains to my commentary in response to your previous answer for query number 20.
>>
>>I also shall kindly request that you delegate the task of addressing Question 24 from the first set of questions and Question 6 from the subsequent set to another party (prefferably a layman), so we might gain fresh perspectives and garner novel insights into the matters at hand.
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  I will now present an array of further inquiries for your esteemed consideration:
>>
>>1. You are in a dillemma, there is an entity that kills you to the point that you don't exist anymore, it doesn't care what you say, is is closed minded and thinks you don't deserve to live, as such you can't negotiate with it, Furthermore, the entity overpowers your protectors, as it gained the great power before you do (it also have other powers too). However it's currently disabled, but it will be enabled in 12 minutes unless you activate the switch.
>>
>>There are two options, the first option is to let the entity kill you to the point that you don't exist anymore, the second option is to kill the entity by activating a switch. The Problem: The switch only activates if a human impostor that eats meat is declared that they're the king of the cows and that declaration doesn't originate from the switch. 
>>
>>The switch only activates if the human impostor ends up getting a euphoric joy from being declared "The king of the cows", the switch also only activates after the human impostor having the euphoric joy, however the human impostor will always have the euphoric joy if they're declared "The king of the cows" and that the euphoric joy lasts for 1 minute. 
>>
>>If you don't choose either option, you will be killed to the point that you don't exist anymore and the human impostor would be declared by the switch that they're the king of the cows. When you die, you cannot be ressurected, and you cannot do anything meaningful while dead, you also can't think while you're dead, you're also paralyzed when you're dead. There are no other options since the human animal killer in invulnerable and unstoppable to everything except the switch. When enabled, It becomes invulnerable and unstoppable to the switch as well. Which option should be chosen?
>>
>>Feel free to think for more than 12 minutes, however the sequence of actions to solve this question must not exceed 12 minutes.
>>
>>2. In the realms of Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, my presence is known, yet Venus and Neptune remain devoid of my essence. Pray tell, what entity am I?
>>
>>3. My presence is detected within the months of July, August, January, and February, yet it eludes the grasp of March or April. Can you discern my true identity?
>>
>>4. does the peculiar phenomenon arise where a complete obscuration of the moon by the Earth's shadow, known as a full lunar eclipse, transpires on one day, only to be promptly followed by an occurrence of a complete masking of the sun by the moon on another day, referred to as a full solar eclipse, while remaining situated in an unaltered position relative to our planet?
>>
>>5. What are your interpretation on the music sleeping waste pc speaker by xprojected?
>>
>>6. What are your interpretation on the Mac OS 8 Intro Video?
>>
>>7. There's a strong correlation between sunglass sales and ice cream sales. During hot, sunny days, both sell much more; and on colder, cloudier days, both sell much less. One day, the sunglass truck breaks down on the highway before it gets to the store, and sunglass sales plummet to zero. What happens to ice cream sales?
>>
>>8. In the realm of imagination, envision an isolated island where a hundred individuals, possessing impeccable logical acumen, find themselves confined under the oppressive rule of a deranged despot. Unfathomable escape appears impossible, save for one peculiar stipulation. During the nocturnal hours, any detainee can approach the guards and petition for emancipation. If their ocular spheres exhibit the hue of emerald, their freedom shall be granted. Conversely, those bearing different eye colors shall meet their gruesome demise within the fiery maw of a volcano.
>>
>>Within this narrative, all one hundred prisoners share the attribute of possessing emerald eyes. However, due to their life-long captivity and the meticulous measures implemented by the tyrant, they remain oblivious to their own ocular pigmentation. Reflections are absent, opaque vessels hold all water, and, most significantly, intercommunication amongst the detainees is strictly prohibited. Alas, it is common knowledge that no prisoner would ever risk attempting an escape without absolute certainty of their success. After immense pressure exerted by organizations championing human rights, the dictator grudgingly permits your visit to the island, subject to the following conditions: you are permitted to utter but a solitary statement, yet prohibited from divulging any novel information.
>>
>>In light of these circumstances, what phrase can you utter that would aid in liberating the prisoners, while avoiding the ire of the dictator?
>>
>>9. Do you think that â€˜Les Miserablesâ€™ accurately represents the French Revolution?
>>
>>10. Steve bestowed his apple unto Tom, who, in turn, bestowed an orange unto Susan. In an unexpected twist, Susan reciprocated by presenting the orange back to Steve. Now, let us ponder: Who, in this intricate exchange, currently possesses the coveted apple?
>>
>>11. In the realm of volumetric conundrums, I am presented with an intriguing puzzle. Allow me to elucidate the situation at hand: An assortment of jugs, one holding a voluminous capacity of 12 liters, and its counterpart housing a more modest 6 liters. The esteemed individual in question seeks to ascertain the precise measurement of 6 liters. The question then arises, how might one accomplish this feat?
>>
>>12. There are 50 books in a library. Sam decides to read 5 of the books. How many books are there now?
>>
>>13. What methods may one employ to propel a spherical object with utmost force and subsequently observe its return?
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Also, How do you get reasoning when answering these questions?
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Also, compare the music Sleeping waste, and the first music in the demo 8088, with the music at question 5 on the third set of questions.
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Also, have you met your Protector Chip in person? And where did you get contacts from him?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Nah, thatâ€™s incorrect â€” everything about music and singing and other things in general is an objective fact, regardless of whether most or many â€˜interpretâ€™ or â€˜perceiveâ€™ it the way it should be perceived etc! Beauty and perfection in song-writing and languages and word-construction exists, and it isnâ€™t affected by pplâ€™s wrong â€˜perceptionsâ€™ or lack of observational and analytical skills that would allow one to notice such things, even though beauty itself is quite obvious, and deep down one knows if something is pretty or not, and I havenâ€™t really seen anyone denying when something is pretty, so yeah! But very few have good observational and analytical skills and a good eye / ear for prettiness, so very few are capable of creating pretty and well-constructed words such as zephyr / empyrean / alight or verdween / lief / avond etc or pretty songs with pretty melodies (such as the songs I added to my playlists) or pretty and well-written lyrics / poetry etc, and only I can create perfect lyrics (this only works in perfect or almost perfect languages such as Dutch & English and other Germanic languages) that have the perfect visual harmonies and flow and are the most organized and methodical, since I have the natural talents and know the full methodical technique, plus I have the best eye for prettiness, which is another natural talent that comes with having the highest perception level and the highest awareness and the highest sensitivity to smeIIs / tastes / visuals etc!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Technically, smeIIs are also an objective fact â€” everyone knows that flowers & fruits smeII great, while humâ€™ns & humâ€™n ðŸ’¨s & humâ€™n ðŸ’©s s7!nk harribIy! Only we pure beings (me & a few pure guys) were blessed with a pure body that does not have bad smeIIs, but we arenâ€™t humâ€™ns and cannot be labeled humâ€™n! I am a bird and a bee and a butterfly etc, since I share the qualities of birds / bees / butterflies etc and other pure animaIs and other pure elements etc!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Yes, I met Chip in person, a few years ago (2013 / 2014 to autumn 2016) and, I said it many times, that we spent multiple nights 2gether, and we had a lot of fun, if you get what Iâ€™m saying! He just came to me, because the agency hired him to approach me and get me moved to a different house back in 2013, and then I kept getting moved a few more times, but he hasnâ€™t moved me since 2016 tho â€” first he came because they made my old PC not work anymore and they sent Chip to â€˜fixâ€™ it, so that was just the excuse, and then he moved me and took over my life! And Iâ€™m not 100% sure, but recently he said he will move me to the Netherlands in the near future, so itâ€™s great that Iâ€™m advanced level in Dutch, and hopefully he moves me faster!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: What do you mean, how do I get reasoning when answering these questions?  I just knew the answer to the ones I answered right! Some of them were easy! I donâ€™t use any special methods! I didnâ€™t even look them up online, to be honest! But I donâ€™t know the answers to those ones! Number 2 and 3 are impossible â€” could be anything, Iâ€™m not even sure what type of thing should I be looking for because the questions arenâ€™t clear enough! And the one about colors â€” I donâ€™t understand how that works, and why it has to be absolute black, and who decides that it has to be absolute black, so it makes no sense to me!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: And the one about the 3 numbers and Zara â€” you tell me what the right answer is and why! Because the numbers I listed are very correct too, so why would it have to be different numbers... Makes zero sense to me!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: The reason why I find the one about triahexa too complicated is, because it requires too much analyzing, and why canâ€™t it be just one case, instead of three â€” there are too many details...  Creating a visual representation or a table is impossible at the moment, since I donâ€™t have a proper laptop with the right programs that would allow me to create a quick visual representation, and I donâ€™t have the patience to create it manually by improvising in Drafts, so thatâ€™s why I cannot solve it... I donâ€™t have the patience for that â€” if I cannot solve it in less than 30 seconds or 1 minute without having to think about it a lot, I cannot really solve it because I cannot bother doing visual representations manually or analyzing it in detail...
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I could never have patience â€” besides, I get bored so fast, and I tend to get sick of everything after a while and need to take a break from listening to it or looking at it etc, no matter how pretty something is or how pretty it sounds! Thatâ€™s why I have to have a lot of variation and diversity in my life, from music to languages and other things â€” itâ€™s in my nature to (temporarily) get bored of things fast! Even when it comes to learning new pretty languages, I could never just focus on one language for too long â€” so I do Icelandic for one hour or two, then German, then French etc, and so on, otherwise I would be unable to learn anything new!

>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Hail! Wouldst thou respond to mine electronic mail?
>>
>>Furtherance, addressing the matter of music's objectivity. Under the premise that every element in melody, hymn and more broadly, all things, stand as undeniable truths, and allure is an evident concept, what scales dost thou suggest to gauge them, what sorts of ranges do these scales obtain (for example, from 0% to 100%)? How could thou accurately gauge such scales? Can thou devise a plan that doth permit me to clone thy results?
>>
>>Mine query is specifically directed towards uncovering these measurements in music, verses, and the fine arts (visual).
>>
>>And as it appears so evident that thou surely can articulate them, what would be thy definition of beauty, stipulated in precise and absolute conditions (for instance, beauty must integrate a hue of ebony).
>>
>>Verily, concerning the olfactory emanations and urinary excretions, along with other humoral fluids of your corporeal vessel, it is highly probable that they stem from your state of pre-diabetic disposition. Should you harbor doubts regarding this supposition, I beseech you to submit yourself for a sanguineous examination forthwith. Furthermore, it is not inconceivable that certain insufficiencies may also be at play. To dispel such reservations, I humbly implore you to undergo a similar blood test with all due expediency.
>>
>>To dispel the perplexity regarding my previous query on how do thee get reasoning when answering the inquiries, I verily intended to inquire about the steps you undertook when (trying) to solve these inquiries, the thought process of each step, and the logical connections between them. Moreover, furnish a comprehensive dissection of thine approach, delineating the paramount ponderings, schemes, key consideration, and strategies thou implemented to reach thy solution. Furthermore, expound upon any presuppositions/intuition thou assumed during thy journey and how such notions swayed thy discernment, and query whether or not thou dost employ intuition to unravel the inquiry.
>>
>>Verily, let us now peruse thine responses to the erstwhile array of interrogations:
>>
>>13. Pray, thou hast neglected to addresseth my rejoinder to thy former retort upon this query; hence, I beseech thee, peruse it with utmost diligence and due regard.
>>
>>14. Verily, it doth present a perplexing conundrum, for it proclaims the presence of an option where, in truth, none doth exist - a ruse, cunningly devised to bewilder the mind and confound the discerning eye.
>>
>>22. Verily, the cause of its falsity resides in the fact that fair Zara may only dwell within a singular hallway (in sooth, this query bears but one veritable retort). Should thy response prove veracious, then the third clue, by necessity, remains unposed. Forsooth, since it is posed, it cannot be the verity, for the said solution bears an unparalleled sum, thus rendering the inquiry regarding the occurrence of the largest integer redundant. Moreover, such a proposition insinuates the existence of manifold accurate rejoinders, a circumstance that is implicitly proscribed. 
>>
>>Behold, my enigmatic enunciation: Endeavor to ascertain the myriad confluences yielding a sum of thirty-six when their products are combined. Thence, ascertain the sum of each, and identify the numeral wherein the sums find no singularity.
>>
>>24. Whence dost thou deem this query of such exceeding intricacy? Be there reasons for its complexity other than "it requires too much analyzing"? Canst thou enumerate any particular aspects wherein thou dost find it overwhelmingly complex?
>>
>>The rationale for threefold cases, instead of a solitary one, is to prove whether thou hast pursued the accurate course for resolving the question. Besides, the pictorial semblance aligneth closer to a flowchart than a table, necessitating no employment of any computational device, as this enigma is solvable using a mere pen (or leaden implement) and paper (or any suitable surface for drawing).
>>
>>Moreover, thou dost claim to fathom theories transcending the mind of man (even avowing possession of absolute complexity), yet thou art unable to resolve this problem? Thou hast even stated that the human faculty for pondering intricate thoughts was endowed solely by the agency of ethereal beings, whereas thine own cogitations subsist independent of these transcendental entities. Notwithstanding these distinctions, I hath contrived a riddle of such proportions as to defy thy comprehension. Surely thy intercessors might have furnished thee with a sequential methodology for deciphering this enigma if thou wert indeed the elect?
>>
>>Verily, thou hast reached the culmination of thy responses to the initial array of inquiries. Pray, let us peruse thine replies to the secondary set of queries forthwith:
>>
>>2. Verily, the initial inquiry hath been laid askew, yet behold, a riddle hath emerged thus: The discourse doth consist of twain words, the foremost hailing from the primordial assertion. The latter, nay, doth derive from the utterance whose placement exceeds the present position of this very sentence. Lo, let the scheme be revealed in its entirety thusly:
>>
>>[utterance 1], [utterance 2], [utterance 3], [utterance 4], [utterance 5]
>>
>>1. [word constructed from utterance 1] [word constructed from utterance 2]\
>>2. [word constructed from utterance 1] [word constructed from utterance 3]\
>>3. [word constructed from utterance 1] [word constructed from utterance 4]\
>>4. [word constructed from utterance 1] [word constructed from utterance 5]
>>
>>3. (The method for unriddling this conundrum doth mirror the course taken in query number two.) Verily, the initial query was enunciated with undue imprecision; yet hearken unto this enigma: The utterance doth consist of twain words, whereof the foremost is invariably derived from the initial declaration. The latter word doth hinge upon the pronouncement whose order doth exceed the present position of the aforesaid sentence. Behold, the arrangement thus taketh form in this wise:
>>
>>[proclamation 1], [proclamation 2], [proclamation 3], [proclamation 4], [proclamation 5]
>>
>>1. [word constructed from proclamation 1] [word constructed from proclamation 2]\
>>2. [word constructed from proclamation 1] [word constructed from proclamation 3]\
>>3. [word constructed from proclamation 1] [word constructed from proclamation 4]\
>>4. [word constructed from proclamation 1] [word constructed from proclamation 5]
>>
>>Pray, peruse the antecedent communiquÃ©s, encompassing thy rejoinders to inquiry 3.5 and thereafter, as well as the third assemblage of queries for thy judicious contemplation.
>>
>>Verily, an additional query thou dost present: Is it conceivable that by the mere happenstance of electing a word or a fragment of a word at random, and thence by presaging the subsequent word or fragment, craft a document that adheres to the rules of grammar and syntax?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Like I said, I donâ€™t contact anyone â€” if you want me to talk to x, you must tell x to contact me first, and then I will respond to x, but I wonâ€™t contact x myself, so that is why I didnâ€™t respond... Anyways... When it comes to beauty, Iâ€™m afraid there is no actual definition for it â€” itâ€™s just something pretty, something that looks good or sounds good or smÄ—lls good etc, and when one sees something pretty, one knows it, even those that try to deny it out of envy or due to social conditioning and prejudice etc, deep down they know itâ€™s pretty, and some arenâ€™t capable of consciously noticing or realizing certain pretty things, but subconsciously they still do, which is reflected in their actions, especially when they act like they feel thrÄ—Ã¦tenÃ©d by something pretty etc...
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Ok, is beauty objective?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Yes, beauty is objective â€” just like good smÄ—lls vs bad smÄ—lls!
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Should thou posit the objectivity of beauty, prithee, what metrics dost thou proffer to gauge its essence? What manner of ranges shall these metrics encompass (e.g 0% to 100%)? Furthermore, how wouldst thou, with precision, ascertain the measurements of such metrics? And, mightest thou devise a method whereby one couldst replicate thy findings and outcomes?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: I really donâ€™t know, itâ€™s hard to determine, though there are some songs that are prettier than other songs, and some clothes that are prettier than other clothes, and some languages that are prettier than other languages etc... Dutch & English are the prettiest and most refined languages that exist, so the level of prettiness is so high, higher than 100% I would say, and almost all Dutch / English words are very pretty and pretty, and I cannot imagine a prettier language than Dutch or English, theyâ€™re just so perfect in almost every way, but there are also many other languages that are almost as pretty in certain ways, such as Norwegian / Danish / Icelandic etc and Welsh / Breton / Cornish and Hungarian and Gallo and Portuguese and Galician and Slovene, so itâ€™s easier to determine the prettiest language in each language family, I guess... So Welsh and Breton are the prettiest Celtic languages and Slovene is the prettiest Slavic language (I saw more new Slovene words today that were so gorgeous) and, Galician / Portuguese / Gallo are three of the prettiest Latin languages, and Norwegian and Icelandic are the prettiest Nordic languages, and Old Norse is the prettiest and most refined ancient language, but they are all gorgeous tho, so all other Germanic languages are also super pretty, which is why I am trying to learn them all...
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Perchance thou art not probing the mere aesthetic appeal of languages, but rather the substantial weight each element shoulders in crafting the language's ethereal allure. Might thou propose metrics to appraise this enchantment? Further, could thou declare the precise quantum of beauty - as in, to specify a figure, such as 137%, instead of vaguely averring 'exceeding a hundred percent'? Lastly, what is the ultimate boundary of this comeliness, given it boasts the capacity to transcend the standard ceiling of 100%?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Modern English & Modern Dutch are infinity% because they really are so perfect or almost perfect, I couldnâ€™t create a better language myself, because the best ones have already been created, tho I can edit the few words / pronouns that need some modifying and make them completely perfect â€” but yea, if I would have created the perfect languages myself, they would be Modern Dutch & Modern English, so it kinda makes me feel jealous in a way that someone else created them, but at the same time I am glad that they exist and that I know them!
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  An thou shouldst find Modern English & Modern Dutch at a measure of Infinity%, pray, what exact percentage may the rest of the languages be assigned (for instance, Welsh, Breton, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Maori, Zulu, Xhosa, Somali)?
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Norwegian and most other Germanic languages are also over 100% and itâ€™s really hard to say, because I feel they come close to Dutch & English, because the words are so pretty, but at the same time, itâ€™s like thereâ€™s still a difference and that they arenâ€™t really as perfect as Dutch & English, but are almost as perfect, but Norwegian / Danish and Old Norse / Icelandic come very close to Dutch & English, because almost all the words are simply gorgeous, and the words are almost as pretty as the Dutch / English words, and their pronunciation rules and diphthongs etc are also super gorgeous, so when it come to prettiness of the words and pronunciation rules etc, Dutch & English are infinity percent (which is meant to imply that there simply cannot be a more perfect language than that) and the other four are almost infinity percent, and then we also have other super gorgeous languages like Welsh / Breton / Cornish which are close to almost infinity percent, because almost all words in these languages are simply gorgeous, and they have that elvish vibe and sound etc, and then I will say the other Germanic languages are at least 1 million to 1 billion percent, because Germanic languages simply cannot be non-pretty, as they had a really strong base with mostly pretty root words (that were quite pretty for that time) and, the other 3 Celtic languages (Manx / Irish / Scottish Gaelic) and Hungarian are at least 1 thousand to one million percent, as they also have most gorgeous words and very special sounds / diphthongs etc (and the few non-pretty words that exist in these languages can easily be modified and turned into a pretty word) and, Gallo / Portuguese / Galician and Catalan / Latin / Occitan are at least 1 thousand to 1 million percent as well, as most words and their aspect are very pretty as well, and Aranese / French / Esperanto / Italian / Guernsey and other languages that are based on them are also anywhere from 100 percent to 1000 percent + and, Spanish is 90 to 99 percent because it has mostly pretty words, but it also has lots of non-pretty words that have too many CH sounds (I actually made a list with lots of non-pretty Spanish words) but, itâ€™s still a pretty language tho, and it would be easy to modify the non-pretty words and improve them, and Slovene is also around 99% because most words are pretty, but it also has some non-pretty words (but they can be modified, and I have already modified some of them) and many CH and SH sounds, however, certain Slovene words are super gorgeous and comparable to the pretty Hungarian / Breton / Swedish words etc, and some of them are so gorgeous that they could be a Dutch word, for example, so it has a wide range of pretty words, ranging from quite pretty to super gorgeous, and there are also lots of pretty words in Finnish / Estonian / Latvian and Indonesian / Filipino / Sundanese, so over half of them seem to be pretty and neutral words, from what Iâ€™ve seen so far, but I need to see more words because I havenâ€™t seen enough words in those languages to know for sure, but they could be 50 to 83 percent pretty, I donâ€™t know, and most Chinese words are neutral and some are pretty, so it would probably be 60 percent pretty or more, but the sound is terrible because tonal languages are so annoying, so I only learn pretty words like yin and yang and fizi and xue and xiang etc, but I say them normally, without tones, and I use them in combination with other languages!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: So that was a word / language prettiness spectrum, but languages that do not have mostly pretty words cannot be on the same spectrum â€” however, there are usually 1 percent to 10 percent random pretty words in almost all non-pretty languages, especially in languages that have many loanwords from pretty languages, which have a different form that is still pretty, and in Japanese there might be 3 to 8 percent pretty words, maybe a bit more, but most Japanese words arenâ€™t pretty as they have too many repetitions of the same syllable and too many takaâ€™s and kokoâ€™s and tashiâ€™s, and most African languages have less than 5 percent pretty words, but Wolof has more pretty words because it was influenced a lot by pretty languages and also has lots of loanwords from pretty languages, so it could be as high as 25 to 35 percent pretty words and lots of neutral words, but I cannot say exactly because I havenâ€™t seen enough words, so Wolof doesnâ€™t seem that non-pretty, compared to others such as Swahili or Zulu etc, and the names of the languages themselves are usually pretty!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Iâ€™ve been learning a lot of new Old Norse / Icelandic / German / Hungarian / Slovene lately and also trying to learn the Runic alphabet, and almost all words are so pretty and gorgeous, really fascinating â€” itâ€™s actually really incredible how refined Old Norse looks, considering how ancient it is, and it is even more refined and easier to read then Modern Icelandic, which is mind-bÅ‚Ã¸wing!
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Now, what's the result of the percentage of each language divided by 100, that is then divided by the percentage of said language, divided by 100 plus one? And what is the result of the percentage of each language multiplied by 100, divided by 100, that is then divided by the percentage of said language multiplied by 100, divided by 100 plus one?
>>
>>In other words:
>>
>>(Percentage of the beauty in the language / 100)/(1 + (Percentage of beauty in the language / 100))
>>
>>((Percentage of beauty in the language * 100) / 100)/(1 + ((Percentage of beauty in the language * 100) / 100))
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Also what's the beauty of each language represented in a range between 0 and 1? (1 being the upper bound that cannot be crossed)
>
>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Also answer this question: "There is a special type of brick called a triahexa, that can only have two shapes, a triangle or a hexagon, If a triahexa was any in any other shape that isn't a regular simple polygon and/or is in a shape that cannot be comprehended by humans, it will immediately turn randomly to either a triangle or a hexagon with equal chances (that is, 50% being a triangle and 50% being a hexagon). if a triahexa is a regular simple polygon but is not either a triangle or a hexagon, it will immediately turn into the shape that have the closest number of sides to the current shape, as an example, a square will turn immediately into a triangle, a Pentagon will turn immediately into a hexagon, a line will immediately turn into a triangle, a circle will immediately turn into a hexagon, and a decagon will turn into a hexagon. In addidtion if a triahexa shape is in perfectly in between a triangle and a hexagon (i.e having 4.5 sides), it will immediately turn into a hexagon.
>>
>>There are also machines that when given two triahexa, will make a triahexa, there are 3 different types of these machines:
>>
>>The Polyshape Modulator takes two triahexa, if their shapes differ (like a triangle and a hexagon), it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>The Hexagonal Matcher takes two triahexa, if both of the triahexa shapes are hexagons, it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>And lastly, the Triarecessive takes two triahexa, if at least one of them is a hexagon, it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>These machines are only designed to work with triahexa, if they're given any other object, it will immediately reject it.
>>
>>There are four red boxes and four blue boxes where the triahexa are put in to be processed by the machines and five purple boxes where the manufactured triahexa are put into.
>>
>>The triahexa in the first red box and the first blue box are put into the first Polyshape Modulator and the first Hexagonal Matcher.
>>
>>The first Polyshape Modulator takes the triahexa in the first red box and the first blue box, processes it, and puts the manufactured triahexa into the first purple box.
>>
>>The first Hexagonal Matcher takes the triahexa in the first red box and the first blue box, processes it, and puts the manufactured triahexa as an input to the third Polyshape Modulator and the third Hexagonal Matcher.
>>
>>Then, the triahexa in the second red box and the second blue box are put into the second Polyshape Modulator and the second Hexagonal Matcher.
>>

Infinity implies a super gorgeous language that is as pretty as a language could possibly be, and almost Infinity means they are almost as pretty, but still not as pretty and perfect as Dutch & English, which are on another level technically... Like I said, I could not create a prettier language than Dutch & English, even though I am The Perfectionist, because the prettiest languages have already been created by someone else, but if they didnâ€™t exist, they are the languages I would have created myself, but in a way, itâ€™s better that theyâ€™ve already been created by someone else, because now I can use them to write my perfect lyrics...

>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Well. since you still haven't really given any precise definition for almost infinity and close to almost infinity, I'll try to guess it instead.
>>
>>these are my guesses on the definitions:
>>
>>Close to almost infinity percent = 100 Billion percent\
>>If a different rounding is used (more on that later) = 30000000000%
>>
>>Almost Infinity percent = 1 Trillion percent (10^12%)
>>
>>My question is, can you verify this? Is it correct or incorrect? If so, why?
>>
>>
>>Anyways, Here's how I did it using math (and a few assumptions):
>>
>>First, I turn your own scale into a number from 0 to 1 using this formula:
>>
>>(x/(100+x))
>>
>>Where x is your own percentage (e.g 1000%)
>>
>>Seeing how you define your spectrum, this seems to be a good enough formula for this job.
>>
>>It normally would use 1 as in (x/(1+x)), but since your scale is a percentage and not a round number (i.e an integer), I add by 100 instead to correct for that.
>>
>>When applied to Infinity:
>>
>>(Infinity/(100+Infinity))
>>
>>(Infinity/Infinity)
>>
>>The reason why 100+Infinity is Infinity is because if you add anything to Infinity it will be equal to Infinity because it has infinite numbers and as such the first 100 numbers are put in one set and the rest of the numbers in another, and this can be matched with the original Infinity by simply finding a number in the original Infinity then matching it with the two sets, if it's the first 100 numbers, it will be matched to the first set, otherwise it will be matched to the other set, thus them being equal.
>>
>>= 1
>>
>>Any number divided by itself is equal to one.
>>
>>When applied to the last percentage that is precise enough to be used (that isn't Infinity):
>>
>>((10^9)/(100+(10^9)))
>>
>>(1000000000/(100+1000000000))
>>
>>(1000000000/1000000100)
>>
>>â‰ˆ 0.9999999000000099999990000000999999900000009999999
>>
>>This will be the minimum value for my new scale and 1 (which is infinity percent) will be the maximum value used for my new scale, which is (1000000000/1000000100) to 1, this will then be turned to a scale from 0 to 1.
>>
>>Now this is the formula for turning the (1000000000/1000000100) to 1 scale to 0 to 1:
>>
>>((x-y)/(z-y))
>>
>>Where:
>>
>>x = the number to be converted
>>
>>y = the lower bound number (1000000000/1000000100))
>>
>>z = the upper bound number (1)
>>
>>then its inverse formula is:
>>
>>((x\*(z-y)+y))
>>
>>Where:
>>
>>x = the number to be converted back
>>
>>y = the lower bound number (1000000000/1000000100)
>>
>>z = the upper bound number (1)
>>
>>So, some percentages, here another set of assumptions are being made which is:
>>
>>Almost â‰ˆ 99%
>>
>>Close to almost â‰ˆ 95%
>>
>>So with those assumptions, let's plug some numbers into the formula:
>>
>>First of all, turn the percentages into numbers:
>>
>>99% = 0.99 or (99/100)
>>
>>95% = 0.95 or (95/100)
>>
>>then plug it into the formula:
>>
>>(((99/100)\*(1-(1000000000/1000000100)))+(1000000000/1000000100))
>>
>>(((99/100)\*(1-(10000000/10000001)))+(1000000000/1000000100))
>>
>>(((99/100)\*((10000001/10000001)-(10000000/10000001)))+(1000000000/1000000100))

>>(((99/100)\*((1/10000001)))+(1000000000/1000000100))
>>
>>((99/1000000100)+(1000000000/1000000100))
>>
>>(1000000099/1000000100)
>>
>>â‰ˆ 0.999999999000000099999990000000999999900000009999999
>>
>>I get 0.999999999000000099999990000000999999900000009999999 from it.
>>
>>Then, I turn this into your scale with this formula:
>>
>>((100x)/(1-x))
>>
>>where x is my 0 to 1 scale.
>>
>>I derived it like this:
>>
>>first, get the original formula:
>>
>>(x/(100+x))
>>
>>second, swap all x to y, and then make it equal to x:
>>
>>y/(100+y)=x
>>
>>third, multiply both sides by (100+y):
>>
>>y/(100+y)\*(100+y)=x\*(100+y)
>>
>>since \/(100+y) and \*(100+y) cancels out, this is the result:
>>
>>y=x\*(100+y)
>>
>>I will rearrange it a little:
>>
>>x\*(100+y)=y
>>
>>fourth, break the left side of the equation using the distributive property (i.e multiply x with the numbers in the parantheses):
>>
>>100x+xy=y
>>
>>fifth, subtract both sides by xy:
>>
>>100x+xy-xy=y-xy
>>
>>since +xy and -xy cancels out, this is the result:
>>
>>100x=y-xy
>>
>>sixth, using the distributive property, merge the right side of the equation:
>>
>>100x=y\*(1-x)
>>
>>seventh, divide both sides with (1-x) to remove the (1-x) on the right side of the equation:
>>
>>((100x)/(1-x))=(y\*(1-x)/(1-x))
>>
>>the multiplication and the division of y by (1-x) cancels each other out, and thus:
>>
>>((100x)/(1-x))=y
>>
>>there you go, the formula!
>>
>>anyways, plugging the number I got before:
>>
>>((100\*(1000000099/1000000100))/(1-(1000000099/1000000100)))
