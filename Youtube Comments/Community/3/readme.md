>>co-jt6gd (1765co): Compression, please? I’m noticing a lot of circumlocution in what you described…
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: Where exactly is the circumlocution? I write the way it feels the most natural, it’s my style of typing... Plus some ideas are very important and should be mentioned twice or thrice! The idea that the words with different spelling should be moved to the main languages is the main idea of this post, and it would have sounded like something was missing if this idea wouldn’t have been repeated again where necessary, and it’s also a way to empathize this idea, so that one doesn’t forget what the main idea is! It cannot be called circumlocution, and there’s certainly not a lot of it at all as this is the only Idea that I repeated twice or thrice!
>
>>co-jt6gd (1765co):  @FrozenMermaid666  Your message is very repetitive and the meanings of your wording aren’t always clear, that’s what that means. No disrespect intended, it just makes it harder to read.
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: And, yé know what! If one doesn’t want to read the facts to become informed, one shouldn’t be reading my posts at all, as it’s definitely way better than having x or y trying to tell ME how to write my own posts, pfff! Truly, a very tóxic group of ppl, so one naturally feels like not even going online after reading such negative nonsense, and actually, I have already experienced all sorts of bs on yt, from entitled db trying to find ‘flaws’ in my perfect and unique ways of writing and trying to tell me how to write my own comments and posts to slumbering dysléxik db daring to tell me to insert spaces as they have difficulty reading long full-on text (the problem is clearly them, not my writing, since I have zero difficulty reading and re-reading my comments without spaces) to db envious phïhggíds trying to prevent the truth from reaching the masses (and selling obvious bs such as ‘their’ bs ‘methods’ and other lies to the db masses that will buy any bs) to all sorts of db cræy trøllz haræssing me for no ef reason (just for stating the facts) to db ímpøstuhr promoters that dared to misuse my big terms and my respectability pronouns that are only meant for me THE superior / pure being and that dared to put a bunch of wæshed-out öude hógs and bétühs on undsrvd pedestals where they do not belong yet having the audacity to censór the truth when correcting the db ímpòstühs to lots of other lówłíves, pfff, and it only goes to show that this is truly a beyond backwards wørłd that shouldn’t have been created at all! What I say is the most important truth and the most important ideas that all should be happy to read and hear multiple times and all should be grateful and thankful I took the time to share such important facts and ideas! And if one is too db to be grateful and see the truth and prefers to stay db and hernwashed, one might as well ef off my yt, for I am not interested in reading any negative ns! If it’s not a positive comment where one praises me and expresses his gratitude and agreeing with the obvious facts, one should keep it to oneself!

>>FrozenMermaid666: If I had the power, I’d totally væpp each enemy (including ímpóstr promoters / bétuhs / ímpóstrs / truth-deniers and truth-censoring ßküm / entitled voolz trying to correct ME the Goddess etc) in one second — hüm’n = 💩 for sure!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: So far, every single group of ppl that I came across was / is total shÿte, including the language ‘learning’ ‘community’ and the ‘vegan’ ‘community’ and the ‘reading’ ‘community’ etc and all others, just a bunch of pøsers that aren’t what they claim to be and that clearly don’t enjoy reading long well-written posts, so one can tell one doesn’t even read anything important, just short bs comments that the avrg db posts on yt, judging by this shÿte attitude, and just trying to play ‘intellectual’ on the Internet, but I can see right thru that bs — ppl are clearly getting more and more db’ed down, and also leyzier a leyzier, like, how leyzi can one be to be bothered by one line being repeated 3 ef times to emphasize it lmao 😂 like, seriously, get real!
>
>>FrozenMermaid666: How is it not clear? Which message or which part is not clear? I clearly stated that one of my wishes is to get all the words from unofficial languages (aka languages that aren’t officially recognized as a language and that are incorrectly referred to as ‘dialects’ of the official language) that have different spelling (aka spelling that isn’t the same as the spelling in the official language) included in some of the unofficial languages that have mostly words with different spelling, to reduce the number of unofficial languages, without losing any of the words that have different spellings or even different meanings etc, because in most unofficial languages most words still have the same spelling and the same meaning as they do in the official language, and there are way too many of them, so I cannot learn them all!

>>AccSwtch50:  @FrozenMermaid666  Hey there, I decided to give you a riddle from 8 months ago and I will give some simplification before giving you that:
>>
>>A triahexa, in a nutshell only has two shapes, a hexagon or a triangle.
>>
>>Also you can use a pen/pencil and paper or any writing tool and its accompanying writing surface to note down some structure/important information in this riddle.
>>
>>Here's the riddle:
>>
>>There is a special type of brick called a triahexa, that can only have two shapes, a triangle or a hexagon, If a triahexa was any in any other shape that isn't a regular simple polygon and/or is in a shape that cannot be comprehended by humans, it will immediately turn randomly to either a triangle or a hexagon with equal chances (that is, 50% being a triangle and 50% being a hexagon). if a triahexa is a regular simple polygon but is not either a triangle or a hexagon, it will immediately turn into the shape that have the closest number of sides to the current shape, as an example, a square will turn immediately into a triangle, a Pentagon will turn immediately into a hexagon, a line will immediately turn into a triangle, a circle will immediately turn into a hexagon, and a decagon will turn into a hexagon. In addidtion if a triahexa shape is in perfectly in between a triangle and a hexagon (i.e having 4.5 sides), it will immediately turn into a hexagon.
>>
>>There are also machines that when given two triahexa, will make a triahexa, there are 3 different types of these machines:
>>
>>The Polyshape Modulator takes two triahexa, if their shapes differ (like a triangle and a hexagon), it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>The Hexagonal Matcher takes two triahexa, if both of the triahexa shapes are hexagons, it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>And lastly, the Triarecessive takes two triahexa, if at least one of them is a hexagon, it will make a triahexa in the shape of a hexagon, otherwise it will make a triahexa in the shape of a triangle.
>>
>>These machines are only designed to work with triahexa, if they're given any other object, it will immediately reject it.
>>
>>There are four red boxes and four blue boxes where the triahexa are put in to be processed by the machines and five purple boxes where the manufactured triahexa are put into.
>>
>>The triahexa in the first red box and the first blue box are put into the first Polyshape Modulator and the first Hexagonal Matcher.
>>
>>The first Polyshape Modulator takes the triahexa in the first red box and the first blue box, processes it, and puts the manufactured triahexa into the first purple box.

>>The first Hexagonal Matcher takes the triahexa in the first red box and the first blue box, processes it, and puts the manufactured triahexa as an input to the third Polyshape Modulator and the third Hexagonal Matcher.

>>Then, the triahexa in the third red box and the third blue box are put into the fourth Polyshape Modulator and the fourth Hexagonal Matcher.
