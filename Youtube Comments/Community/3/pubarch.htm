      </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">I think I am close to having a breakdown, okay, maybe not exactly that, but I definitely feel like yelling at some ppl, like, those ppl that created a zillion versions of the same base language, like, why did they have to create a zillion Norwegian-based / Swedish-based / Danish-based and Dutch-based / German-based languages, why couldn’t there be one version only, as English has, with the same type of spelling, that still looks like the same language?! There’s no way I could learn all those languages, so I was thinking that maybe there’s a way to combine as many of the most similar ones as possible, by only using the words that have a different spelling from the spelling of the official language, because I noticed that many words have the same spelling as the official version of the word, so by combining only the different words from multiple similar languages, the total numbers of languages could probably be reduced to a more manageable number that I could learn, it’s definitely kind of useless and unnecessary to have so many different versions, especially considering the fact that many of them only have like 50 percent or 30 percent of the words with a different spelling, while many or most of the words still have the spelling of the original version, like, is it really necessary to have so many versions... It’s quite obvious that many of the dudes from those countries got very creative with the language and decided to create their own versions by modifying half or a few of the words from the base language, and there are also some of those languages that look more like Icelandic and Old Norse than Norwegian... I also noticed some of the dialects of Swedish that seem to look exactly like standard Swedish, so if they only have a few specific words, those words should just be included in Standard Swedish as synonyms, so that one doesn’t have to go thru all the words that are exactly the same with the exact spelling as the Standard Swedish spelling, just to learn the different words, so the most logical thing to do would be to move the different words to Standard Swedish and also the extra meanings that certain words may have in the dialect versions, so that one could learn the complete set of words and meanings by just learning the standard version, so that one can easily understand all the different words that are specific regional words etc, so they should definitely hire ppl to sort thru the words and create the complete version of Swedish etc, and the same can be said about the dialects of Norwegian / Danish etc that aren’t really a different language with different spelling and that only have a few word differences and extra terms used in certain regions only, I don’t know why they aren’t doing anything to make the official languages more complete and to remove unnecessary dialects that are basically exactly the same as the standard language with a few extra words, which would definitely make communication a lot easier and would make the Standard version of the language more complete, and the other ones with different spelling should be combined into fewer new languages, based on languages that look the same, and grouping them and the different words in a way that would reduce the total number of dialects (or languages that aren’t the official version) without losing any word that has a different spelling that is different or even slightly different from the word used in the official version, and, it would be way better and easier to learn all the different words with different spellings, while also making the total number of languages more manageable and easier for someone to learn them all... I am sure that by combining all the different words with different spelling into fewer languages, based on their spelling, one would make it possible for all the differently spellt words to fit into way fewer languages... If I could find full lists with each word that’s used in each Germanic dialect / language, I would and I might even try going thru them myself and combining them into fewer languages myself, to make sure that no differently spellt word is lost, because a word is a different word, even if it’s just slightly modified with an E instead of É etc... Because right now, there are zillions of dialects and languages, that I just wouldn’t have enough time to learn them all, so it’s way easier to just learn the differently spellt words, by adding them to fewer languages that would have all the words with different spelling, not only half or a quarter etc of the words, which would make it way more manageable and each language more complete and more unique... I will definitely focus on the official version of the language for each group of languages first, and then I will decide how I get all the differently spellt related words / cognates learnt!</p><p>

Plus some ideas are very important and should be mentioned twice or thrice! The idea that the words with different spelling should be moved to the main languages is the main idea of this post, and it would have sounded like something was missing if this idea wouldn’t have been repeated again where necessary, and it’s also a way to empathize this idea, so that one doesn’t forget what the main idea is! It cannot be called circumlocution, and there’s certainly not a lot of it at all as this is the only Idea that I repeated twice or thrice!</p><p>

Truly, a very tóxic group of ppl, so one naturally feels like not even going online after reading such negative nonsense, and actually, I have already experienced all sorts of bs on yt, from entitled db trying to find ‘flaws’ in my perfect and unique ways of writing and trying to tell me how to write my own comments and posts to slumbering dysléxik db daring to tell me to insert spaces as they have difficulty reading long full-on text (the problem is clearly them, not my writing, since I have zero difficulty reading and re-reading my comments without spaces) to db envious phïhggíds trying to prevent the truth from reaching the masses (and selling obvious bs such as ‘their’ bs ‘methods’ and other lies to the db masses that will buy any bs) to all sorts of db cræy trøllz haræssing me for no ef reason (just for stating the facts) to db ímpøstuhr promoters that dared to misuse my big terms and my respectability pronouns that are only meant for me THE superior / pure being and that dared to put a bunch of wæshed-out öude hógs and bétühs on undsrvd pedestals where they do not belong yet having the audacity to censór the truth when correcting the db ímpòstühs to lots of other lówłíves, pfff, and it only goes to show that this is truly a beyond backwards wørłd that shouldn’t have been created at all! What I say is the most important truth and the most important ideas that all should be happy to read and hear multiple times and all should be grateful and thankful I took the time to share such important facts and ideas! And if one is too db to be grateful and see the truth and prefers to stay db and hernwashed, one might as well ef off my yt, for I am not interested in reading any negative ns! If it’s not a positive comment where one praises me and expresses his gratitude and agreeing with the obvious facts, one should keep it to oneself!</p><p>

      </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">So far, every single group of ppl that I came across was / is total shÿte, including the language ‘learning’ ‘community’ and the ‘vegan’ ‘community’ and the ‘reading’ ‘community’ etc and all others, just a bunch of pøsers that aren’t what they claim to be and that clearly don’t enjoy reading long well-written posts, so one can tell one doesn’t even read anything important, just short bs comments that the avrg db posts on yt, judging by this shÿte attitude, and just trying to play ‘intellectual’ on the Internet, but I can see right thru that bs — ppl are clearly getting more and more db’ed down, and also leyzier a leyzier, like, how leyzi can one be to be bothered by one line being repeated 3 ef times to emphasize it lmao 😂 like, seriously, get real!</p><p>

      </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">How is it not clear? Which message or which part is not clear? I clearly stated that one of my wishes is to get all the words from unofficial languages (aka languages that aren’t officially recognized as a language and that are incorrectly referred to as ‘dialects’ of the official language) that have different spelling (aka spelling that isn’t the same as the spelling in the official language) included in some of the unofficial languages that have mostly words with different spelling, to reduce the number of unofficial languages, without losing any of the words that have different spellings or even different meanings etc, because in most unofficial languages most words still have the same spelling and the same meaning as they do in the official language, and there are way too many of them, so I cannot learn them all!</p><p>
