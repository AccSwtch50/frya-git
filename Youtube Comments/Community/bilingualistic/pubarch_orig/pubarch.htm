And it also explains why he created the dinosaurs and then _ed them in very crueI ways because they were so huge and would’ve stomped and _ed everything, and then he decided to create humnz, and only allowed animaIs that were not that huge, which was not random — nothing seems random because it isn’t!</p><p>

And it makes sense that he can also influence what humnz and other animaIz do or think, since it’s also possible in this world... And maybe he realized that it was an universal error, long after he created this wrong world and the humnz and the other mammaIz, so it explains why he created the agents, that would observe and come to these conclusions, since they are the only ones that can break the vicious cycle — they have the power in this world, and it is to be given to me after The Great Reset in TNW!</p><p>

And my _ also does not _ the room, unlike the _ of humnz. So it is true that I have the qualities of birds, especially when it comes to body composition — birds’ doo-doo doesn’t smeII / doesn’t have a harrible smeII either, and bees make honey etc, which is sweet, so I am more similar to birds and bees etc!</p><p>

But the one that created this world can include new ideas in my mind from The Outside, just as agents do here in this wrong world, via mind ctrI / hypn_ and, this explains why he included things like WiFi in this world, because he wanted humnz to observe that it is possible to send information from point A to point B in indirect ways, and he probably uses very advanced tech that sends impulses to hum’ns’ minds while unconscious that translate to information / thoughts / ideas when they are conscious, which is why seemingly random thoughts seem to magically pop op in one’s mind that that person would never think or imagine on its own, that aren’t really random, so this is also probably how he made humnz do certain actions and discover certain things that led to the creation of things such as languages / tech etc, which were in fact already programmed / decided by him, but he then introduced them to humnz gradually / slowly, in order to make it seem like ‘fate’ or a coincidence etc...</p><p>
