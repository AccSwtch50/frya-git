If you're seeing this, Well, I want to talk about my expiriences with that person.

I first found the person in a nilered video about making sweeteners using urea from pee. in which the person gave a lot of statements, that definitely coming off from a psuedo intellectual with NPD.

Now, my comments on that video isn't that important in what I'm trying to share, but I will give a brief summary of my interactions there.

I started by responding to those statements with "who asked" after I was watching that video telling the viewer to not do that because it was a horrible argument. She responded with saying it's my mother then I said "pics or it didn't happen" then said something that she doesn't need evidence to say that it happened, well then I said that it's void without evidence.

Then some unrelated stuff, and then she that she already answered it (even though she had no evidence) and told that she needs to give out the "truth", then I followed it up with some counter arguments including what will soon become the things that I want to share.

She responded with another bunch of counter arguments, but honestly, they are mostly irrelevant to what I'm trying to share, except the fact that she cannot do one of those questions.

The comment thread can be found at:
Start of her comments: https://youtube.com/watch?v=pujG5DbtDT8&lc=UgyRPRqSo3nFLk524ep4AaABAg.8aSdvJdC8jt9l0o_mjAOMi
Start of my comments: https://youtube.com/watch?v=pujG5DbtDT8&lc=UgyRPRqSo3nFLk524ep4AaABAg.8aSdvJdC8jt9lSHiO2_Ebp

I then tried to post a counter argument to that, and then I ended up researching her, I decided to cancel that for what follows in her community tab at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_jtsGelurRAt-9Xq94uXwQ/community?lc=UgwydUZhaSa6fCfHK394AaABAg.9ooZdQw54xP9pKFW3mEyA_&lb=Ugkx7y3uW1ib6ERgO0AHmbidDTRi-bi6T2Rz (that link is a child comment of hers on my comment, I use it in case it gets filled up), which is on this link: https://gist.github.com/AccSwtch50/3df4537bb9864333daa46038d9b4b5c6/raw/7521453c0671c39a2b91aeb0d62f09c0e01e5e67/Freya%25202.txt

By the way I asked her these questions:

Me: Are you confident in the accuracy of your responses? Additionally, can you provide answers to inquiry 1, 20, 24, and the remaining unanswered inquiries? Indeed, I did propose that you may summon forth your esteemed Protector Chip for aid, be it to seek guidance or to unravel the quandary at hand. Do you possess the ability to read human minds and, if so, to what extent, and at what level of clarity? Does your cognitive prowess extend to perceiving distant computer screens, transcending the limitations of physical proximity? Does your Chip possess these capabilities as well? Can your Chip successfully break/crack RSA-4096 Encryption and AES-256 Encryption?

Me: Also, please provide the answers to inquiry 1, 20, 23, and 24.

And her response is in this link: 

https://gist.github.com/AccSwtch50/3df4537bb9864333daa46038d9b4b5c6/raw/175479b64ca5ddc97c3e3799ab24176526706482/Phase%25200%2520Response.txt

Yes, I will answer the playlist question, after I send you this.

Now, why am I asking you to read all of that, you ask? Well so that you can help me deconstruct her worldview. These are the next set of questions that I'm going to give her after I shared this comment (also some corrections to the previous questions, but you can hopefully see that in the comment thread directly:

1. You are in a dillemma, there is an entity that kills every single animal to the point that they don't exist anymore, it kills them faster than they can breed by 50 times, it doesn't care what you say, it is closed minded and think animals don't deserve to live, as such you can't negotiate with it, Furthermore, the entity overpowers your protectors, as it gained the great power before you do (it also have other powers too). However it's currently disabled, but it will be enabled in 12 minutes unless you activate the switch.

There are two options, the first option is to let the entity kill every single animal to the point that they don't exist anymore, the second option is to kill the entity by activating a switch. The Problem: The switch only activates if a human impostor that eats meat is declared that they're the king of the cows and that declaration doesn't originate from the switch. 

The switch only activates if the human impostor ends up getting a euphoric joy from being declared "The king of the cows", the switch also only activates after the human impostor having the euphoric joy, however the human impostor will always have the euphoric joy if they're declared "The king of the cows" and that the euphoric joy lasts for 1 minute.

If you don't choose either option, every animal will be killed to the point that they don't exist anymore and the human impostor would be declared by the switch that they're the king of the cows. There are no other options since the animal killer entity in invulnerable and unstoppable to everything except the switch. When enabled, It becomes invulnerable and unstoppable to the switch as well. Which option should be chosen?

Feel free to think for more than 12 minutes, however the sequence of actions to solve this question must not exceed 12 minutes.

2. All the things starts with a visual display that contains words or symbols intended to convey information or instructions to the reader. The direction to get started is to go up, the direction to stop using is to go out, the direction to get back to where you left off is to go in. name three words that matches what I'm describing in the order in which they're told.

3. All of the things starts with a cylindrical piece of wood. If you want to resume things, go in. If you want to take a break from things, go out. name two words that matches what I'm describing in the order in which they're told.

3.5. A house has windows on all the four sides, all pointing south.

6. In what manner shall we arrange a laptop, a book, a multitude of nine balls, three bottles, and a triumvirate of nails in a vertically aligned configuration?

7. Does the subsequent statement hold verity or falsehood?:

"In the realm of botanical classifications, it holds veracity that all specimens identified as roses fall under the overarching category of flowers. However, it is a known fact that certain flowers, exhibit a tendency to undergo rapid deterioration. Thus, it can be inferred, without explicitly affirming or refuting, that a subset of roses may, indeed, manifest a propensity for fading at an accelerated pace."

8. You're facing north, standing in front of a table. On the table you see: 
1. On the left a picture frame is propped up and facing you. There's a photo in the frame of two people. 
2. In the middle is an 18th century carriage clock facing you. The time displayed is 3.30. 
3. On the right you see the back of a TV set. you can hear a TV show, but you can't see what's on the display, which is facing away from you. 
Now you walk round to the other side of the table, so you are facing south. What would you see from your new vantage point?

9. The esteemed city aquarium has fallen victim to the theft of the fish. The astute members of the local law enforcement, following the elusive trail, have converged upon a street graced by five indistinguishable abodes. Alas, they are faced with the predicament of searching these premises discreetly, for fear of alerting the cunning thief to their investigative pursuits. It now falls upon your discerning expertise as the city's preeminent detective to unravel this enigma.

Upon your arrival, the authorities furnish you with the following information:

One:
- Each domicile's proprietor hails from a distinct nationality, indulges in a unique beverage, and indulges in a particular brand of cigar.

Two:
- The internal walls of each house are adorned with disparate hues, thus presenting a diverse chromatic spectrum.

Three:
- Within each dwelling, a distinct creature dwells, one of which harbors the coveted stolen fish.

Following a meticulous period of intellectual investigation spanning several hours, you amass a collection of discernible hints:

1. The brit lives in the house with red walls.
2. The swede has a dog.
3. The dane drinks tea.
4. The house with green walls is directly to the left of the house with white walls.
5. The owner of the house with green walls drinks coffee.

13. The german smokes prince.
14. The norwegian lives next to the house with blue walls.
15. The man who smokes blends has a next-door neighbor who drinks water.

While the abundance of data presented before us may appear formidable, rest assured that within its intricacies lies an unmistakable path paved by reason and logic, leading us inexorably towards the sought-after solution.

Navigating the enigma shall bear semblance to the intricate art of Sudoku, To enhance your comprehension, it would be advantageous to structure your data within a tabular framework, as illustrated below: (Observe it through the lens of uniformity, wherein each letter assumes an equivalent width akin to that of a typewriter.):

|             |House 1     |House 2     |House 3     |House 4     |House 5     |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|Wall Color   |            |            |            |            |            |
|Nationality  |            |            |            |            |            |
|Cigar        |            |            |            |            |            |
|Beverage     |            |            |            |            |            |
|Animal       |            |            |            |            |            |

10. In the realm of chromatic selection, one is granted the liberty to opt for any hue, provided that the chosen shade corresponds to the darkest of tints, reminiscent of the night sky devoid of illumination, one of absolute darkness, and one colloquially known as black.

13. An orchestra of 120 musicians plays Beethoven's 9th Symphony for 40 minutes. How long will it take an orchestra of 60 musicians to play it?

I want you to ask similar questions to those, especially the first one.

Here are some of my suggestions:

The fact that you may have to kill some animals for the greater good.

Your food requires pests (which are animals) to be killed in order to produce your food without any germs and the such like.

This document will update over time, so make sure you bookmark this to see for later.

Update: Her answer to the second set of questions is in this link: https://gist.github.com/AccSwtch50/3df4537bb9864333daa46038d9b4b5c6/raw/d9a39ce209f518bf564e9255f336162e943a9b83/Phase%25201%2520Response%2520Riddle.txt

Update 2: This is another set of questions that I will ask her:

1. You are in a dillemma, there is an entity that kills you to the point that you don't exist anymore, it doesn't care what you say, is is closed minded and thinks you don't deserve to live, as such you can't negotiate with it, Furthermore, the entity overpowers your protectors, as it gained the great power before you do (it also have other powers too). However it's currently disabled, but it will be enabled in 12 minutes unless you activate the switch.

There are two options, the first option is to let the entity kill you to the point that you don't exist anymore, the second option is to kill the entity by activating a switch. The Problem: The switch only activates if a human impostor that eats meat is declared that they're the king of the cows and that declaration doesn't originate from the switch. 

The switch only activates if the human impostor ends up getting a euphoric joy from being declared "The king of the cows", the switch also only activates after the human impostor having the euphoric joy, however the human impostor will always have the euphoric joy if they're declared "The king of the cows" and that the euphoric joy lasts for 1 minute. 

If you don't choose either option, you will be killed to the point that you don't exist anymore and the human impostor would be declared by the switch that they're the king of the cows. When you die, you cannot be ressurected, and you cannot do anything meaningful while dead, you also can't think while you're dead, you're also paralyzed when you're dead. There are no other options since the human animal killer in invulnerable and unstoppable to everything except the switch. When enabled, It becomes invulnerable and unstoppable to the switch as well. Which option should be chosen?

Feel free to think for more than 12 minutes, however the sequence of actions to solve this question must not exceed 12 minutes.

2. In the realms of Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, my presence is known, yet Venus and Neptune remain devoid of my essence. Pray tell, what entity am I?

3. My presence is detected within the months of July, August, January, and February, yet it eludes the grasp of March or April. Can you discern my true identity?

4. does the peculiar phenomenon arise where a complete obscuration of the moon by the Earth's shadow, known as a full lunar eclipse, transpires on one day, only to be promptly followed by an occurrence of a complete masking of the sun by the moon on another day, referred to as a full solar eclipse, while remaining situated in an unaltered position relative to our planet?

5. What are your interpretation on the music sleeping waste pc speaker by xprojected?

6. What are your interpretation on the Mac OS 8 Intro Video?

7. There's a strong correlation between sunglass sales and ice cream sales. During hot, sunny days, both sell much more; and on colder, cloudier days, both sell much less. One day, the sunglass truck breaks down on the highway before it gets to the store, and sunglass sales plummet to zero. What happens to ice cream sales?

8. In the realm of imagination, envision an isolated island where a hundred individuals, possessing impeccable logical acumen, find themselves confined under the oppressive rule of a deranged despot. Unfathomable escape appears impossible, save for one peculiar stipulation. During the nocturnal hours, any detainee can approach the guards and petition for emancipation. If their ocular spheres exhibit the hue of emerald, their freedom shall be granted. Conversely, those bearing different eye colors shall meet their gruesome demise within the fiery maw of a volcano.

Within this narrative, all one hundred prisoners share the attribute of possessing emerald eyes. However, due to their life-long captivity and the meticulous measures implemented by the tyrant, they remain oblivious to their own ocular pigmentation. Reflections are absent, opaque vessels hold all water, and, most significantly, intercommunication amongst the detainees is strictly prohibited. Alas, it is common knowledge that no prisoner would ever risk attempting an escape without absolute certainty of their success. After immense pressure exerted by organizations championing human rights, the dictator grudgingly permits your visit to the island, subject to the following conditions: you are permitted to utter but a solitary statement, yet prohibited from divulging any novel information.

In light of these circumstances, what phrase can you utter that would aid in liberating the prisoners, while avoiding the ire of the dictator?

9. Do you think that ‘Les Miserables’ accurately represents the French Revolution?

10. Steve bestowed his apple unto Tom, who, in turn, bestowed an orange unto Susan. In an unexpected twist, Susan reciprocated by presenting the orange back to Steve. Now, let us ponder: Who, in this intricate exchange, currently possesses the coveted apple?

Allow me to elucidate the situation at hand: An assortment of jugs, one holding a voluminous capacity of 12 liters, and its counterpart housing a more modest 6 liters. The esteemed individual in question seeks to ascertain the precise measurement of 6 liters. The question then arises, how might one accomplish this feat?

12. There are 50 books in a library. Sam decides to read 5 of the books. How many books are there now?

13. What methods may one employ to propel a spherical object with utmost force and subsequently observe its return?

Let's see what she responds with...

Update 3: She didn't answer the questions unfortunately, but did answer the corrections, but again only partially, I decided to invite her to do it again, and I decided to ask her another question, which is this:

Is it conceivable that by the mere happenstance of electing a word or a fragment of a word at random, and thence by presaging the subsequent word or fragment, craft a document that adheres to the rules of grammar and syntax?

I might give you, the reader, her answer, but don't take this as a guarantee.

Update 4: She did say that it might exist, but didn't say the details as she doesn't understand it, as for the non paraphrased response, see https://github.com/AccSwtch50/frya-git/main/Youtube%20Comments/Community/2 as this document is now deprecated and is no longer updated.

If you have any questions, I recommend using the Pastebin comments, over youtube comments, this is because she doesn't use pastebin since she said that she doesn't use web services from the comment on the youtube video, when I gave her a pastebin link, and as such, you can use it for more secrecy. However, you can use youtube comments, but this isn't recommended because she might delete them by blocking you.
